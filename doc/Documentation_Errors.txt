1. In http://www.dartlang.org/articles/embedding-in-html/ it is specified that we can use document.getElementById(), but actually i was not able to use this, the only way to get an element is using document.query()

2. In http://www.dartlang.org/language-tour/ -- "StringBuffer methods" example misses a space, It should be sb.add("Use a StringBuffer ");
